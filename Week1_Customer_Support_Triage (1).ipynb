Loaded the dataset using Pandas.\n","2. Cleaned the data: handled missing values, removed duplicates.\n","3. Preprocessed text data: cleaned ticket descriptions using regex.\n","4. Performed data analysis: calculated averages, counts, and trends.\n","5. Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n","\n","## Results / Findings\n","- **Total records:** 10,000\n","- **Average ticket length:** 56.7 characters\n","- **Peak ticket activity observed in month:** August\n","- Charts show trends in ticket volume and category distribution.\n","\n","### Example Visuals\n","- **Ticket Volume Over Time:** Shows how many tickets were received each month.\n","- **Category Distribution:** Shows the proportion of tickets per category.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","This analysis highlights key trends in customer support tickets.  \n","**Recommendation:** Focus on resolving tickets in categories with the highest volume to improve efficiency.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7eQD2Oop5Rj3"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"xNfmzz39lUZ6"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import re\n","from
